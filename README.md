# Sepia Mobile Application

## Note:

1. This project needs a mysql database and also a php file to run,
   which doesn't exist in the project, any contributor needed the files should ask azhy, because this repository is not safe to publish these files into (this is public and anyone in the world can access it).

## TODO:

1.  password encryption in transferring to the server and also while checking

2.  storing user ID in shared preferences should be more secure.

3.  use @ symbol in sql commands to make it more secure if needed.
