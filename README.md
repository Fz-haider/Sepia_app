# Sepia Mobile Application

## Note:

1. This project needs a mysql database and also a php file to run,
   which doesn't exist in the project, any contributor needed the files should ask azhy, because this repository is not safe to publish these files into (this is public and anyone in the world can access it).

## TODO:

1.  password encryption in transferring to the server and also while checking

2.  storing user ID in shared preferences should be more secure.

3.  use @ symbol in sql commands to make it more secure if needed.

4.  There are too much tasks in the main thread which will decrease the apps performance.

5.  (Solved) Note that TeacherPost class is used in both cases (teacher and parent) so the ViewPost class of parent is not used, if this class was enough for both of them we will bring it out from teacher_pages package, and if not we will use the ViewPost instead.

6.  We need a loading screen if we did too much work on the screen.
